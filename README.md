### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student that spends my freetime devloping Java based applications for my own fun. I started devloping for the popular sweedish game Minecraft and slowly worked my way into coding plugins for the game. Ever since then I have enjoyed the idea of creating my own projects. I used my skills to establish wildblock a game focused coding team that takes on multiple projects.
