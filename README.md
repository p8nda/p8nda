### Hi there 👋

I'm a student that spends my freetime devloping Java based applications for my own fun and productivity. I started devloping for the popular sweedish game Minecraft and slowly worked my way into coding plugins for the game. When I left the game to move on to bigger things, that Java development knowledge never left me and I found myself using code in other ways and established a GitHub profile to store my creations.

I used my minimal Java skills to establish "wildblock" a game focused coding team that takes on multiple projects. Here, you can explore some things that I'm working on. I joined GitHub back in 2017 to help orginize some thoughts and projects either with a team or solo.

A little bit about me:

* My perferred language is Java. ☕
* I'm currently working on a Java management plugin. 🛠️
* Lemonde is my favorite drink while coding. 🍋
* You can contact me using Telegram: @kingpolar8 📫

Thank you for reading. 🐼
