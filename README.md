### Hi there 👋

I'm a student that spends my freetime devloping Java based applications for my own fun and productivity. I started playing the game Minecraft and slowly worked my way into coding plugins for myself in the game. When I left the game to move on to bigger things, that Java development knowledge never left me and I found myself using Java code in other ways and established a GitHub profile to store my creations.

I used my minimal Java skills to establish "wildblock" a game focused coding team that takes on multiple projects. Currently I'm working on expanding my coding knowledge and taking on some new challenges. Here, you can explore some things that I'm working on. I joined GitHub back in 2017 to help orginize some thoughts and projects either with a team or solo.
